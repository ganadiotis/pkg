PKG - Personal knowledge graphs - is the informal name we've been using.

Here is a draft [[Personal Knowledge Graph Definition]]

If we decide to go with PKG, PKG Society might be a good name

Another idea would be to refer to Emergent, rather than Personal, KGs

This name may be more accurate, in terms of capturing the evolving nature of PKGs

This is something we've referred to over time, i.e. the fact that nurturing and managing one's own PKG may be the first step to sharing parts of it, leading to emergent bottom-up KGs
