Markdown is seen as a de-facto interoperability layer among PKG tools

Markdown is easy to use, however it also has some issues:
* Many tools extend standard Markdown in ad-hoc ways
* There are no standards for including semantics in Markdown
	* Something like JSON-LD or RDFa for Markdown would be an interesting direction to explore
