A [[PKG Use Case Template]] has been adopted, based on the [W3C eGov Wiki Use Case Template](https://www.w3.org/egov/wiki/Use_Case_Template)

List of [use cases in Paco Nathan's PKG Github](https://github.com/ceteri/pkg/tree/main/Use%20Cases)

More [use cases by Ivo Velitchkov](https://github.com/ceteri/pkg/issues/2)

Each use can be developed according to the template in a separate Note

Example: [[Conversation Archiving]]
