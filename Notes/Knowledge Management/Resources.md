We should probably organize all the resources we have referred to over time in some repository

Here is an (uncurated and incomplete) [list on raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/ganadiotis/personal-knowledge-graph-13180173)

This tool has the option of adding collaborators who can edit the collection, and it can also export it in standard bookmark format

Other suggestions welcome too
